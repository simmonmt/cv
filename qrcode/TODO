Better positioning point vetting. unparseable_v10.png has a false positive that
happens because we're too optimistic. We can't handle cases that look like this:

          ..XX.X.XX
          .XX...X.X
          .XX***..X
          XX.***X.X
          ...***.XX
          X.X..X...
          XXXX.XXXX

The block of '*'s is what we think is the positioning block center.
